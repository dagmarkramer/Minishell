INTRODUCTION
------------

this is our own shell, we had to recreate bash and had to code our own builtins

the project showed us how to implement pipes, redirections, heredoc, environment variables and much more

we added wildcards as a bonus


UTILISATION
------------

run 'make' to make the library

run './minishell' to enter the shell

enter any bash commands
